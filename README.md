# Transport-demand
AI-Based Transport Demand Forecasting
Overview

This project uses Artificial Intelligence and data analytics to analyze and predict passenger demand in urban transport systems. The goal is to improve route planning, fleet utilization, and operational efficiency through data-driven decision-making.

Objectives

Analyze passenger demand patterns

Identify peak hours and high-load routes

Measure vehicle utilization

Forecast future demand using machine learning

Generate data for dashboard and managerial insights

Dataset

Synthetic dataset with 300 hourly transport observations including:

Datetime

Route_ID

Passenger_Count

Vehicle_Capacity

Weather

Day_Type

Fuel_Cost_Per_Trip

Traffic_Level

Methods

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory data analysis
